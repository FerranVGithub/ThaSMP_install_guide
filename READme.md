# Hey guys. Quick message here if you want to spare yourself some time setting up the instance.

* Carry over your options/config from your previous instance (if you have any):
  *  Modrinth:
     * Step 1: Right click on your previous instance and press `open folder`

      * Step 2: Here you will see all sorts of crazy files. Make sure to select `options.txt` as well as the `config` folder. (you can also select `saves` and `schematics` if you want your worlds and schematics to be transfered to your new instance as well).

      * Step 3: Hit copy (`ctrl+c`)
   
      * Step 4: Go back to the modrinth app where you installed `ThaPack` instance and follow repeat step 1 on that new instance.
   
      * Step 5: Paste (`ctrl+v`) the files inside the instance folder. If you see any prompts, click replace all. You are now done transfering the settings/config from your old instance to the new instance.


   * Curseforge:
     	* Step 1: Right click on your previous instance and press `open folder`

		* Step 2: Select the `config` folder as well as `options.txt` (if you want to transfer your worlds and schematics too, you can also select those folders). You may have to scroll a bit to find the `options.txt` file, but it will be there.

   		* Step 4: Go back to Curseforge and repeat step 1 on the newly installed instance.
